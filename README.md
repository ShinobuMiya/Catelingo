# Catelingo
Fix LLM hallucinations instantly without retraining.  Catelingo is a Git-based semantic layer that treats meaning as version-controlled code. When an AI fails due to ambiguity, simply commit a new concept decomposition to the Atlas. It integrates directly into the inference pipeline, allowing developers to hotfix reasoning logic via Pull Requests.
